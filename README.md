## Multi-Tenancy Model

| Concept | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Tenant unit | `Club` row with a unique `slug` |
| Subdomain routing | `slug.yoursaas.com` → proxy injects `x-club-slug` header |
| Tenant resolution | `lib/tenant.ts → resolveTenantFromRequest()` reads the header, looks up `clubId` |
| Data isolation | Every DB model has a `clubId` FK. Every query `WHERE clubId = ?` |
| Cross-tenant guard | `requireAdmin()` re-reads `clubId` from the DB — JWT value is ignored for the WHERE clause |
| Local dev | `club-a.localhost:3000` → gym A, `club-b.localhost:3000` → gym B, plain `localhost:3000` → platform (no env var needed) |

**Security contract:** A token from Club A used on Club B's subdomain is rejected at the `requireX()` layer — the user's `clubId` from the DB is compared against the resolved club from the subdomain.

---

## Roles & Permissions

| Role | Scope | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPER_ADMIN` | Platform | All clubs, no `clubId`. `/platform` route tree |
| `OWNER` | Club | Full access + SaaS plan management + analytics + billing |
| `ADMIN` | Club | Operational access (members, sessions, coaches, payments). No analytics/billing |
| `COACH` | Club | Own sessions + roster only |
| `MEMBER` | Club | Personal dashboard (bookings, membership, schedule, profile) |

Granular RBAC is in `lib/permissions.ts`. Custom overrides stored in `role_permissions` table (per-club, per-role, per-action).

---

## Feature Map

- Personal KPI cards (active subscription, bookings this week, sessions attended)
- Booking flow — browse schedule, book/cancel sessions
- Membership page — subscribe to a plan, resume pending payment
- Profile management (name, phone, avatar, password, preferences)
- Notification center + real-time SSE bell

### Coach Dashboard `/dashboard/coach`
- Stats widget (totalSessions, bookings, attendances, fillRate)
- Session roster with expandable member list + manual attendance marking

### Admin Panel `/admin`
- **Members** — CRUD, search/filter/paginate, manual plan assignment
- **Staff** — Coaches and admins management
- **Schedule** — Weekly plan builder, session management, activation/archive
- **Bookings** — View/cancel all bookings, sort by session/member/date
- **Subscriptions** — Approve/cancel/suspend member subscriptions
- **Payments** — Manual payment recording, Konnect webhook status
- **Plans** — Gym membership plan CRUD (pricing, duration, quotas)

- **Content** — Website page content editor
- **Logs** — Full activity audit log with filters
- **Settings** — Branding, colors, logo, hero image, social links, working hours
- **Billing** — SaaS subscription status, trial countdown, upgrade CTA

### Platform (Super Admin) `/platform`
- **Clubs — full CRUD** (`/platform/clubs`, see [Platform Admin](#platform-admin--club-management)): create, search/filter/sort, edit, suspend / activate / ban, change plan, extend trial, reset owner password, delete
- Platform-wide activity logs
- SaaS plan management
- System health overview

### Website Builder
- Each club has a public website at `slug.yoursaas.com` with pages: Home, Schedule, Coaches, Pricing, Contact
- Pages toggled per club via `GymSettings.enabledPages`
- `ClubSettingsContext` applies `--primary` CSS variable in real-time
- Content editable from `/admin/content`

### Onboarding `/onboarding`
- 3-step wizard: account → club info → plan selection
- Atomic transaction: Club + OWNER User + ClubSubscription (TRIALING) + GymSettings
- 14-day trial auto-configured
- Auto-login after creation (session handed to the club subdomain through `/api/auth/bridge`)
- Rate-limited (5 clubs per IP per hour); slug availability check is rate-limited too (40/min per IP)
- Reserved subdomains (`www`, `api`, `admin`, `mail`, …) are refused — see `lib/slug.ts`

## Authentication Flow

```
1. User POSTs /api/auth/login {email, password}
2. Server: bcrypt.compare → fetch user from DB (with clubId)
3. generateToken({ id, email, role, name, clubId }) → signed JWT (7 days)
4. Response: Set-Cookie: token=<JWT>; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Secure — HOST-ONLY (no Domain attribute), so a session on
   gym-a.yoursaas.com is never sent to gym-b.yoursaas.com and a SUPER_ADMIN session on the apex is never sent to any club.
   (CSRF covered by the Origin check in proxy.ts)
5. Subsequent requests: proxy.ts reads cookie → verifyToken() → JWTPayload
6. requireX(request): re-fetches user from DB to get current role/clubId
   (JWT value is NOT trusted for DB scoping — DB is the source of truth)
7. Every Prisma query: WHERE clubId = <DB-verified clubId>
```

**Cross-host hand-off:** onboarding runs on the apex; `/api/auth/bridge` sets a fresh cookie on the club's own host.

**Password policy:** 8+ characters, not in the common-password list, not digits-only, not repetitive (`passwordSchema` in `lib/validation.ts`).

**Google OAuth (disabled by default):** `/api/auth/google` → Google → `/api/auth/callback/google` → same cookie flow. The callback runs on the apex host, so it cannot yet hand a session to a club subdomain. It is off unless `GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED=1` (server) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED=1` (shows the button).

---

## Payment Flow (Konnect)

```
Member selects plan
       │
       ▼
POST /api/dashboard/membership/subscribe
  → checkLimit(maxBookingsPerMonth)
  → creates Subscription (PENDING) + Payment (PENDING)
  → calls Konnect API → gets payment URL
  → returns { paymentUrl }
       │
       ▼
Member completes payment on Konnect
       │
       ▼
Konnect GETs /api/payments/konnect/webhook?payment_ref=<ref>
  → finds Payment by transactionId
  → IDEMPOTENCY: if status already PAID → redirect success (no writes)
  → getKonnectPaymentDetails(ref) → verify amount + status
  → $transaction([
      payment.update({ status: "PAID" }),
      subscription.update({ status: "ACTIVE", startDate, endDate })
    ])
  → redirect to /dashboard/membership?payment=success
```

---

## SaaS Billing (Plan Limits)

`lib/plan-limits.ts` exposes three functions:

```ts
checkLimit(clubId, "maxMembers")    // → { ok: boolean, reason?, upgrade? }
checkFeature(clubId, "advancedAnalytics")  // → { ok: boolean, upgrade? }
getFullUsage(clubId)                // → { usage: {}, limits: {} }
```

**Limits enforced at write time (not read time):**
- `maxMembers` — checked on `POST /api/admin/members` + member self-register
- `maxCoaches` — checked on `POST /api/admin/coaches`
- `maxAdmins` — checked on `POST /api/admin/staff`
- `maxBookingsPerMonth` — checked on `POST /api/dashboard/bookings`

**Feature gates** (return 402 + `upgrade: true`):
- `advancedAnalytics` — `/api/admin/analytics`
- `revenueAnalytics` — analytics revenue endpoint

**Trial lifecycle:**
- Club created → `ClubSubscription.status = TRIALING`, `trialEndsAt = now + 14 days`
- Cron `/api/cron/trial-check` runs daily at 06:00 → sets `status = SUSPENDED` on expired trials
- Proxy: SUSPENDED clubs get `{ error: "Club suspendu" }` on all API calls

## Testing

```bash
# Run the whole suite
npx vitest run

# Run only the API suites
npx vitest run app/api/__tests__/

# Run specific suite
npx vitest run app/api/__tests__/tenant-isolation.test.ts
```

### Test Suites

| Suite | File | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `lib/__tests__/auth.test.ts` | JWT sign/verify, role guards |
| OTP | `lib/__tests__/otp.test.ts` | OTP generation + expiry |
| Permissions | `lib/__tests__/permissions.test.ts` | RBAC matrix |
| Rate limit | `lib/__tests__/rate-limit.test.ts` | Upstash sliding window |
| Validation | `lib/__tests__/validation.test.ts` | Zod schemas |
| **Tenant isolation** | `app/api/__tests__/tenant-isolation.test.ts` | Cross-club 403 + WHERE scope |
| **Plan limits** | `app/api/__tests__/plan-limits.test.ts` | 402 on limit hit, 201 below |
| **Webhook idempotency** | `app/api/__tests__/webhook-idempotency.test.ts` | No double-write on repeat call |
| **Onboarding E2E** | `app/api/__tests__/onboarding-e2e.test.ts` | Full club creation flow |
| **Platform club CRUD** | `app/api/__tests__/platform-clubs.test.ts` | Access control, CSRF, validation, conflicts, lifecycle actions, delete guard + order |
| Platform helpers | `lib/__tests__/platform-clubs-lib.test.ts` | Slug rules, custom domains, trial maths, sort whitelist |
| Host parsing | `lib/__tests__/host.test.ts` | localhost, `*.localhost`, apex, multi-label apex (`gymos.com.tn`) |

All tests mock Prisma at module level — no live DB required. The club-delete order was additionally verified against a real PostgreSQL 16 with the tracked migrations applied.

## Project Status — Phases 0–12

| Phase | Name | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Remise en route | ✅ 0 TS errors, 86/86 tests, 108 pages |
| 1–4 | Multi-tenancy foundation | ✅ All 72 API routes scoped by clubId |
| 5 | Dashboards | ✅ Owner / Admin / Coach / Member |
| 6 | Website Builder | ✅ Subdomain proxy + branding + page gates |
| 7 | Plan Limits | ✅ checkLimit/checkFeature on all write endpoints |
| 8 | Onboarding | ✅ 3-step wizard + atomic tx + auto-login |
| 9 | SaaS Billing | ✅ Trial cron + upgrade flow + billing page |
| 10 | Security + Performance | ✅ CSRF + rate limit (proxy) + indexes + logger |
| 11 | Tests | ✅ Tenant isolation + plan limits + webhook + onboarding |
| 12 | Production Readiness | ✅ /api/health + vercel.json + .env.example (Sentry: config stubs only — `@sentry/nextjs` not installed yet) |
| 13 | Platform club CRUD + production pass | ✅ Full `/platform/clubs` CRUD, host-only cookies + working logout, apex-aware tenant detection, reserved slugs, password policy, Google sign-in gated, 404 / robots / sitemap |

### Known Tech Debt

| # | Issue | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/user/onboarding/page.tsx` (Google OAuth phone step) and `/onboarding/page.tsx` coexist — old one should be removed | Medium |
| 2 | `lib/auth-server.ts` may duplicate `lib/auth.ts` — audit and remove | Low |
| 3 | `app/login/page.tsx` duplicates `app/user/login/page.tsx` — consolidate | Low |
| 4 | `coaching/page.tsx` and `activites/*` are static — not yet connected to DB | Low |
| 7 | Google sign-in for club subdomains needs a bridge-style hand-off before `GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` can be turned on | Medium |
| 8 | Deleting a club does not remove its Cloudinary assets | Low |
| 9 | Only the apex has a `sitemap.xml`; club subdomains have none | Low |
| 5 | Sentry is not wired: `sentry.*.config.ts` are empty stubs and `@sentry/nextjs` isn't a dependency | Medium |
| 6 | Removed: SSE now uses Upstash Redis pub/sub (`lib/sse.ts`) with in-memory fallback when Redis isn't configured | — |

## Setup & Environment Variables

### Fastest path (Docker + one command)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fedimezz/saasssss-club.git && cd saasssss-club
bash scripts/fresh-start.sh        # Postgres in Docker → .env → install → migrate → seed → dev server
```

Needs Node ≥ 20.9, Docker, and (on Windows) Git Bash or WSL. Flags: `--no-dev` (setup only), `--reset` (wipe the local DB first).

### Manual setup (your own Postgres)

```bash
npm ci                                  # also runs `prisma generate` (postinstall)
cp .env.example .env                    # Prisma reads `.env`, not `.env.local`; Next reads both
# edit .env: DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL, APP_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, JWT_SECRET, CRON_SECRET
npx prisma migrate deploy               # apply tracked migrations
npx prisma db seed                      # 2 demo gyms, SaaS plans, demo accounts (password: Demo123!)
npm run dev
```

Open `http://club-a.localhost:3000` (gym A), `http://club-b.localhost:3000` (gym B) or `http://localhost:3000` (platform: landing, onboarding, `/platform/login`).
Demo logins: `owner.a@demo.local`, `admin.a@demo.local`, `coach.a@demo.local`, `member.a@demo.local`, `owner.b@demo.local`, `superadmin@platform.local` — all `Demo123!`.
Redis (Upstash), Brevo, Cloudinary and Konnect are optional locally: rate limiting falls back to in-memory and emails are printed to the terminal.

Useful scripts: `npm run validate` (lint + typecheck + tests), `npm run db:studio`, `npm run db:migrate:dev` (create a new migration).

### All Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | ✅ | PostgreSQL connection (Prisma runtime) |
| `DIRECT_URL` | ✅ | Direct connection for migrations (bypasses PgBouncer) |
| `APP_URL` | ✅ | Platform base URL, no trailing slash. **Also defines the apex for tenant detection** (`club.<apex>` = tenant), so multi-label apexes like `gymos.com.tn` work |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | ✅ | Same, exposed to browser |
| `JWT_SECRET` | ✅ | Min 32 chars. `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | ✅ | Upstash Redis URL |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | ✅ | Upstash Redis token |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | ✅ | Image upload |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | ✅ | |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | ✅ | |
| `GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` | Optional | `1` enables the Google OAuth routes (default off) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` | Optional | `1` shows the “Continuer avec Google” button (default hidden) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Optional | OAuth |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Optional | |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` | Optional | |
| `KONNECT_API_KEY` | ✅ | Payment gateway |
| `KONNECT_BASE_URL` | ✅ | |
| `KONNECT_WALLET_ID` | ✅ | |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | ✅ prod | Transactional email via Brevo REST API (dev: emails are printed to the console if empty) |
| `SMTP_FROM` | ✅ | Verified sender address in Brevo |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Optional | SMS |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional | |
| `TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER` | Optional | |
| `CRON_SECRET` | ✅ | Auth header for Vercel Cron jobs (min 16 chars; unset ⇒ all cron calls rejected) |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional | Error monitoring (server) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Optional | Error monitoring (browser) |
| `DEV_DEFAULT_CLUB_SLUG` | Dev only | Leave unset. Makes plain `localhost` act as one gym, which breaks the super-admin login |
| `COOKIE_DOMAIN` | Optional | Leave empty: the session cookie is host-only (safest for multi-tenant). Setting it shares one session across subdomains and weakens tenant separation |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Prod seed | Bootstraps the platform SUPER_ADMIN when running the seed with `NODE_ENV=production` (password 12+ chars) |
| `JSON_LOGS` | Optional | Force JSON log output in dev (`1` = enable) |
| `DEBUG` | Optional | Enable debug logs in production (`1` = enable) |

## Deployment (Vercel)

```bash
# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Required Vercel settings:
# 1. Wildcard domain: *.yoursaas.com → your Vercel project
# 2. Environment variables: copy all from .env.example
# 3. Cron jobs: defined in vercel.json (trial-check, subscription-renewal, session-reminders)
```

**Production database bootstrap (run from your machine or CI, pointing at the production DB — not during the Vercel build):**

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://…"  DIRECT_URL="postgresql://…"   # DIRECT_URL = non-pooled connection
npx prisma migrate deploy                                            # apply tracked migrations (never `db push` / `migrate dev` in prod)

# Seeds ONLY the SaaS plan catalog (+ the platform super-admin if both vars are set).
# In production mode it never creates the demo clubs / demo accounts.
NODE_ENV=production SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL="you@yourdomain.com" SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD="a-long-unique-password" npx prisma db seed
```

Required Vercel env vars before the first deploy: `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` (32+ chars), `CRON_SECRET` (16+ chars), `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, `BREVO_API_KEY`, `SMTP_FROM`, `CLOUDINARY_*`, `KONNECT_*`.

**Wildcard domain setup:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add `*.yoursaas.com` as a wildcard domain
3. Add DNS `CNAME *.yoursaas.com → cname.vercel-dns.com` at your registrar

**Post-deploy checklist:**
- [ ] `GET https://yoursaas.com/api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [ ] Create one club via `/onboarding` — check JWT cookie is set
- [ ] Verify subdomain routes to correct club data
- [ ] Trigger test payment through Konnect sandbox
- [ ] Check Vercel Cron logs after first scheduled run

## Platform Admin — Club Management

`/platform/clubs` (SUPER_ADMIN only — sign in at `/platform/login` on the apex domain).

| Action | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Create** | “Nouveau club” | Atomic: `Club` (TRIAL) + OWNER user + `ClubSubscription` (TRIALING) + `GymSettings` with default pages. Slug auto-filled from the name, plan picker, trial 1–90 days, optional custom domain. The generated owner password is displayed **once**. |
| **Read** | List + detail | Search (name, slug, domain, owner email), filter by status / plan, sort, paginate; detail shows owner, subscription, usage counts, role breakdown, last SaaS payments. |
| **Update** | Detail → “Modifier” | Name, slug, custom domain, owner name / email / phone. Renaming keeps the public site name in sync when it was still the club name. Changing the slug changes the club URL (users must sign in again on the new host). |
| **Suspend / Activate** | List or detail | Blocks / restores login for every user of the club. No data touched. |
| **Ban** | Detail → danger zone | Status `CANCELLED` + subscription cancelled. Reversible with “Réactiver”. |
| **Change plan** | Detail → “Changer de plan” | Creates the subscription row if the club has none. |
| **Extend trial** | Detail | Adds days on top of the remaining trial; also reactivates a club the cron suspended for an expired trial. Refused for paying clubs. |
| **Reset owner password** | Detail | Sets a new password (policy enforced); tokens for password-reset emails are cleared. Existing sessions stay valid until they expire (JWT). |
| **Delete** | List or detail | Permanent. The UI requires typing the slug **and** the API rejects the call unless `confirmSlug` matches. |

**Why delete is not a plain `club.delete()`:** `User.clubId` is `onDelete: Restrict` and `Subscription.planId → MembershipPlan` is Restrict too, so a bare delete fails as soon as a club has one user. `deleteClubCascade()` removes member subscriptions → users → club in one transaction; everything else cascades from `Club`. Delete audit entries are written with `clubId = null` so they survive the club’s own log rows.

**Safety rules**
- Every mutation checks the `Origin` header (CSRF) and `requireSuperAdmin`.
- Slugs: 3–40 chars, `[a-z0-9-]`, no leading / trailing / double hyphen, and never a reserved name (`www`, `api`, `admin`, `platform`, `mail`, …).
- Custom domains are normalised (`https://WWW.MonGym.tn/` → `www.mongym.tn`) and can never equal or sit under the platform domain.
- Unique-index races (slug / email / domain) return `409` with a `field`, not `500`.
- Every action is written to the activity log (`PLATFORM_CLUB_CREATED | UPDATED | SUSPENDED | ACTIVATED | BANNED | PLAN_CHANGED | TRIAL_EXTENDED | OWNER_PASSWORD_RESET | DELETED`). Passwords are never logged.

## Production Checklist

**Before the first deploy**
- [ ] `APP_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` set to the real apex (tenant detection depends on it)
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` (32+ chars) and `CRON_SECRET` (16+ chars) set; `COOKIE_DOMAIN` left **empty**
- [ ] Wildcard domain `*.yourdomain` added in Vercel + DNS `CNAME *` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- [ ] `npx prisma migrate deploy` run against the production DB (never `db push` / `migrate dev`)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production npx prisma db seed` with `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` to create plans + platform admin
- [ ] Upstash Redis, Brevo (`BREVO_API_KEY`, `SMTP_FROM`), Cloudinary, Konnect variables set
- [ ] `GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH_ENABLED` left unset (see tech debt #7)

**After deploy**
- [ ] `GET /api/health` → `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [ ] Sign in at `https://yourdomain/platform/login`, create a test club from `/platform/clubs`
- [ ] Open `https://<slug>.yourdomain`, sign in as the owner, **log out and confirm you are really logged out** (reload the page)
- [ ] Confirm the SUPER_ADMIN session is *not* present on a club subdomain
- [ ] Run a Konnect sandbox payment; check the first Vercel Cron runs
- [ ] Delete the test club from `/platform/clubs`

**CI gate (already in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):** `npm run validate` = ESLint + `tsc --noEmit` + Vitest.
